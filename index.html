        <h2>About the Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation today. It is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's most successful and enduring missions.</p>
        <p>With its ability to observe celestial objects with unparalleled clarity, Hubble has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It has captured breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial phenomena, providing astronomers with valuable data and insights into the cosmos.</p>
        <p>Equipped with advanced scientific instruments, Hubble has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, the identification of new planets, and the study of black holes and dark matter.</p>
        <p>Throughout its mission, Hubble has been a testament to human ingenuity and the wonders of space exploration, inspiring generations with its awe-inspiring images and scientific contributions.</p>

            <h3>1. PILLARS OF CREATION (NEW VIEW)</h3>
            <p>The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has revisited one of its most iconic and popular images: the Eagle Nebula’s Pillars of Creation. This image shows the pillars as seen in visible light, capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds, wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust, and the rust-coloured elephants’ trunks of the nebula’s famous pillars.</p>
            <p>The dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds from massive nearby stars. With these new images comes better contrast and a clearer view for astronomers to study how the structure of the pillars is changing over time.

            <p>This image of a pair of interacting galaxies called Arp 273 was released to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
            <p>The distorted shape of the larger of the two galaxies shows signs of tidal interactions with the smaller of the two. It is thought that the smaller galaxy has actually passed through the larger one</p>

            <h3>3. ANTENNAE GALAXIES RELOADED</h3>
            <p>Hubble has snapped the best ever image of the Antennae Galaxies. Hubble has released images of these stunning galaxies twice before, once using observations from its Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) in 1997, and again in 2006 from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Each of Hubble’s images of the Antennae Galaxies has been better than the last, due to upgrades made during the famous servicing missions, the last of which took place in 2009.</p>

            <h3>4. HORSEHEAD NEBULA (NEW INFRARED VIEW)</h3>
            <p>This Hubble image, captured and released to celebrate the telescope’s 23rd year in orbit, shows part of the sky in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter). Rising like a giant seahorse from turbulent waves of dust and gas is the Horsehead Nebula, otherwise known as Barnard 33.</p>
            <p>This image shows the region in infrared light, which has longer wavelengths than visible light and can pierce through the dusty material that usually obscures the nebula’s inner regions. The result is a rather ethereal and fragile-looking structure, made of delicate folds of gas — very different to the nebula’s appearance in visible light.

            <h3>5. HUBBLE MOSAIC OF THE MAJESTIC SOMBRERO GALAXY</h3>
            <p>Hubble has trained its razor-sharp eye on one of the universe’s most stately and photogenic galaxies, the Sombrero galaxy, Messier 104 (M104). The galaxy’s hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on. We view it from just six degrees north of its equatorial plane. This brilliant galaxy was named the Sombrero because of its resemblance to the broad rim and high-topped Mexican hat.</p>

            <p>This Hubble image – among the largest ever produced with the Earth-orbiting observatory – gives the most detailed view of the entire Crab Nebula ever. The Crab is among the most interesting and well studied objects in astronomy.</p>
            <p>This image is the largest image ever taken with Hubble’s WFPC2 camera. It was assembled from 24 individual exposures taken with the telescope and is the highest resolution image of the entire Crab Nebula ever made.</p>
